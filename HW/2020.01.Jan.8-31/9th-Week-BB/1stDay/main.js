/* 1)Create an object with these keys and values and
    name it foods.
    key     |    value
    name    |    banana
    color   |    yellow
    calori  |    276
    isFamous|    true
    2) log to the console whole object
    3) Ask to user which property would like to see
        (you can use promt)
        when page is opened, a promt window should appear and ask
        for key. Afterwords you should show alert windows with value
        of that key.
    4) Create a button and connect number 3 to this butto
    5) put a button to HTML file. When someone click show a new
        promt and ask which property would like to add.
        Afterwords insert the property to your object.
        !!!It should support space named keys.
    6) One more button for delete some properties. You can use 
        promt and ask the key for delete.
